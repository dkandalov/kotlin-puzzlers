### Kotlin puzzlers

This is a collection of Kotlin puzzlers prepared for 
Kotlin London User Group [meetup in August](https://www.meetup.com/kotlin-london/events/241918493/).

You can find slides for the presentation [here on dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ad1d0lnhsxy29d2/AAAYfnYSMkuOVlSA7NGo-wFba?dl=0)
(not part of this repository because Keynote file is quite large).
You can find outline for the slides in `kotlin-puzzlers.md` file. 

Puzzler is small program which has somewhat unexpected behaviour
and helps to learn about programming language idiosyncrasies.
These puzzlers were inspired by the amazing [Java Puzzlers book](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Puzzlers-Traps-Pitfalls-Corner/dp/032133678X).

You can find more puzzlers in Anton Keks [puzzlers repo](https://github.com/angryziber/kotlin-puzzlers).


### How to use this repo?
There are couple options:
 - download slides [from dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ad1d0lnhsxy29d2/AAAYfnYSMkuOVlSA7NGo-wFba?dl=0),
   open in Keynote app and look at them sequentially
 - look at files in `puzzlers` directory (preferably don't open them in IDE because it might highlight some of issues with the code).
   Guess what the correct answer is, then copy paste code into IDE and run it to find actual answer.
