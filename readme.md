### Kotlin puzzlers

Puzzler is small program which has somewhat unexpected behaviour
and helps to learn about programming language idiosyncrasies.

These puzzlers were inspired by the [Java Puzzlers book](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Puzzlers-Traps-Pitfalls-Corner/dp/032133678X).
and originally prepared for Kotlin London User Group [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/kotlin-london/events/241918493/).

You can find slides for the presentation [here on dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ad1d0lnhsxy29d2/AAAYfnYSMkuOVlSA7NGo-wFba?dl=0)
(not part of this repository because Keynote file is quite large) and outline for the slides in `kotlin-puzzlers.md` file. 

If you're interested there is a larger collection of puzzlers in Anton Keks [kotlin-puzzlers repo](https://github.com/angryziber/kotlin-puzzlers).


### How to use this repo?

There are two options:
 - download slides [from dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ad1d0lnhsxy29d2/AAAYfnYSMkuOVlSA7NGo-wFba?dl=0),
   open in Keynote app and look at them sequentially
 - look at files in `puzzlers` directory (preferably don't open them in IDE because it might highlight some of issues with the code).
   Guess what the correct answer, then copy paste code into IDE and run it to find actual answer.
